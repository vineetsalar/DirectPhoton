\begin{abstract}
 Different scenarios of a first order quark hadron phase transition 
arising from supercooling have been studied in a hydrodynamical 
model. Manifestations of these scenarios in the photon spectrum 
from Pb+Pb collision at SPS energy have been demonstrated.
Possible imprints of these scenarios on the other measured data 
is also discussed.

  The ultra relativistic heavy ion collision experiments are performed 
with the aim to produce matter with very high energy density required to 
form quark gluon plasma (QGP). With this aim, Pb+Pb collision experiments 
at $\sqrt s = 17.6A$ GeV have been carried out at CERN SPS giving a 
variety of data on electromagnetic and hadronic observables
[For a review see~\cite{ESKOLA}]. 
  The most interesting of these are the electromagnetic 
probes~\cite{WA98,CERES}, 
which are sensitive to various stages of the evolution of the system and 
may contain the information on QGP formation. 
  A considerable amount of theoretical work has been done
to extract the information on QGP from these 
data [For review see~\cite{PEITTHOMA,GALER}].

  To explain the data with hydrodynamical models, one assumes that, QGP 
is formed with given initial conditions which then expands
hydrodynamically till it reaches the critical temperature $T_C$ for 
a first order quark-hadron phase transition.
  In the idealized Maxwell construction, the temperature of the system 
is held fixed at $T=T_C$ until the hadronization is completed. 
Thus, in turn one assume that the latent heat obtained by the phase 
transition compensates the temperature drop due to cooling.
Such a picture has been widely used in literature while describing
the electromagnetic signals (See e.g.~\cite{SRIVASTAVA}).
  This is a good approximation when the expansion time scales are far 
greater than the phase transition time scales as in the case of early 
universe. 
  For the case of relativistic heavy ion collisions, there have
been extensive studies of the space time evolution of 
QGP undergoing a first order phase transition by 
nucleation~\cite{CSER,SHUK,INHOMO,ZABPRC}.
  As a result of rapid expansion of the system, a substantial amount of 
supercooling is expected and the dynamics of quark hadron phase 
transition becomes quite different in heavy ion collisions as compared to 
that in early universe~\cite{INHOMO,AKM}. 
 When the hydrodynamical equations are coupled with nucleation rate 
equation~\cite{SPINO}, the QGP is shown to supercool to a temperature 
$T_S$ lower than $T_C$. The hadronization proceeds by thermal fluctuation
from this metastable QGP to stable hadron phase. The system 
reheats due to the release of latent heat and approaches $T_C$ as 
the hadronization proceeds. 
This also corresponds to an equilibrium situation where the latent heat 
generated goes into reheating the system. 

  In heavy ion collisions, the cooling time scales are comparable
to the phase transition time scales, that gives rise to many
interesting possibilities around $T_C$.
  It is possible for example, that QGP supercools to a temperature, 
at which the barrier between the metastable QGP and the stable hadron phase 
minima completely vanishes leading to a point of inflection at 
$T=T_{\rm spino}$. This is known as 
spinodal instability~\cite{SPINO}. In this case, the rapidly quenched 
system leaves the region of metastability and enters the highly unstable 
spinodal region before a substantial amount of nucleation begins.
There is no metastable state from which one can not define the phase 
transition by thermal fluctuation.
   Alternatively, spinodal decomposition has been suggested as a
possible mechanism of phase conversion for a rapidly expanding system of 
quarks and gluons~\cite{SPINO,DUMHEP,DUMPRL}. This hadronization process
is much faster than the nucleation and is  
also referred as explosive decomposition~\cite{DUMEXP}.
 In this scenario, the QGP breaks up into small droplets of plasma in
a non equilibrium way, which will form hadrons. It is unlikely for the 
system to undergo re-equilibration and thus it will freeze out at this point. 
  Such a picture has been presented many times in the literature
and it is referred as `a fast shock like hadronization' in 
Refs.~\cite{CSORGO} and as `a sudden hadronization scenario' in 
Ref.~\cite{RAFEL}.
  The signature of such a scenario will be very short life 
time~\cite{CSERNAI} of the system measured through HBT data
and should combine with no mass shift in $\rho$ and $\phi$ etc.
observed in dilepton spectrum and large departures of hadron spectrum
from equilibrium distribution.

  In case of nucleation, another possibility arises at the late stage of 
hadronization when most of the QGP volume has been converted to hadrons.
%  In full nucleation model one assumes that the already nucleated hadron 
%bubbles join together and the QGP bubbles are trapped inside. 
%Then one can continue with the nucleation model, assuming that these QGP 
%droplets will shrink and the shrinking velocity is equal to the 
%hadron bubble growth velocity. This is a very simplistic picture.
  The system can be considered in the form of hadron clusters and the small 
QGP bubbles. At such a point, fluctuation theory is not applicable for 
hadronization of remaining small fraction of QGP. Further hadronization by 
equilibrium processes stops here and the system may simply break up into 
fragments: hadronic clusters and small droplets of plasma which then form 
the final state hadrons. Such a possibility is presented
in Ref.~\cite{ZABPRC}. 

   As all these scenarios exist in the literature, it is worthwhile 
to see their manifestation in the measured photon spectrum~\cite{WA98}
which is the best probe of space time evolution of 
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) possibly produced in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. While a number of models have been proposed in context 
with photon data, the supercooling, which is an essential feature of 
first order phase transition has never been included to calculate photon 
spectrum. Here we concentrate mainly on this aspect and 
apply the most common set of parameters, equation of state 
and the expansion scenario for our calculations.
  We consider that QGP is formed at some initial temperature 
$T_i=211$ MeV and initial time $\tau_i=0.8$ fm which correspond to
the pion central rapidity density $dN/dy \simeq 700$. This is the upper 
limit of the rapidity density obtained from charged particle 
density measured by NA49 \cite{NA49}. The initial time is close to the most 
accepted value of equilibration time at SPS i.e. 1 fm. 
The QGP cools according to Bjorken (1+1) hydrodynamics. It has been
shown to be as competent as (3+1) dimension expansion at least at SPS
energies \cite{THOMA,STEFF}. This means that at SPS the transverse 
expansion has only minor effects on the photon production.
 Further, a baryon free QGP has been considered. It has been shown 
by a recent study \cite{DIPA} that the space time integrated photon 
yield at SPS is not very sensitive to the presence of baryon density.
  To get the equations of state, it is assumed that QGP is a massless 
2 flavour parton gas. A rich equation of state of hadronic phase can 
be modeled by writing entropy as $4\, g_{\rm eff}(T) T^3 \pi^2/90$.
Here $g_{\rm eff}$ is 3 for a massless three pion gas. We have 
taken $g_{eff}=4.9$ at T=160 \cite{SOM} for a gas consisting 
of $\pi$, $\eta$, $\rho$ and $\omega$ with appropriate mass and 
degeneracies.

 When the QGP cools to the critical temperature $T_C=160$ MeV at 
$\tau_C=1.83$ fm, we invoke following four scenario for the calculations:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Idealized Maxwell construction:
    The temperature of the system is held fixed at $T=T_C$ 
    during hadronization. The hadronization completion time 
    $\tau_h\sim$ 14 fm can be simply calculated by entropy conservation.
    After this, the hadron gas cools to freeze out temperature 
    $T_f=145$ MeV at $\tau_f\sim 19$ fm. Such a calculation is shown by 
    dashed line in Fig.~1.

\item  Nucleation and supercooling scenario:
   At $T=T_C$, hydrodynamical equations are coupled with nucleation 
  rate equations~\cite{SPINO}. The QGP supercools to a temperature 
  $T_S=0.896T_C$. The hadronization proceeds by 
 thermal fluctuation from this metastable QGP phase to stable hadron phase. 
 The system reheats due to the release of latent heat and approaches
 $T=T_C$ as the hadronization proceeds. When hadronization is completed,  
 the hadron gas cools and freezes out at $\tau_f=21$ fm.
 Such a calculation is shown by solid line in Fig.~1.

\item Spinodal decomposition followed by freeze out:
  QGP supercools to the temperature $T=T_S$, which is close to spinodal 
  temperature~\cite{SPINO} which can be calculated as 
\begin{equation} 
T_{\rm spino}= \left[{B \over B+ 27 V_b} \right]^{1/4} \, T_C, 
  \hspace{.5in} V_b = {3\sigma \over 16 \xi}.
\end{equation}
For Bag constant $B^{1/4}$= 219 MeV,
surface tension $\sigma$= 25 MeV/fm$^2$ and correlation length $\xi$ = 0.7 fm,
one can calculate 
$T_{\rm spino}=0.88 T_C$, which is very close to the minimum temperature
in supercooling. 
 The QGP breaks up into small droplets of plasma, which will form 
hadrons coinciding with freeze out at temperature $T_S$ and
time $\tau_s=$ 3 fm.


\item Fragmentation at late stage of hadronization followed by freeze out:

  In the nucleation scenario when most of the QGP volume has been 
converted to hadrons at time $\tau_p$, the system breaks up into fragments: 
hadronic clusters and small droplets of plasma. 
 This corresponds to 99 \%  hadronization at time $\tau_p=$ 15 fm.
This is also assumed to coincide with freeze out.
\end{enumerate}
 It is to be mentioned that, the same supercooling curve is used for 
scenario 2, 3 and 4. They differ only by implementation of freeze
out at different times, due to different physical conditions.


  The total thermal photon emission rate is given by the sum of 
corresponding rates $R_{\rm QGP}$ in the QGP and $R_{\rm hadron}$ 
in the hadron regions integrated over space time volume 
element $d^4x = \tau d\tau d\eta_f \pi R^2$ as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{}
 E \frac{dN}{d^3 p}  &=& \int_{\tau_i}^{\tau_f} \int_{-l}^{l} 
     \left[(1-h(\tau)) R_{\rm QGP}(T(\tau),\eta_f) 
  + h(\tau)  R_{\rm hadron}(T(\tau),\eta_f) \right]d\eta_f \tau d\tau \pi R^2.
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\eta_f$ is the fluid rapidity integrated from 
$-l$ to $+l$ ($l=2.8$) and $R$ is the size of colliding 
nuclei given by $R=1.2\, A^{1/3}$, A=208. 
 The temperature, $T(\tau)$ and the hadronic fraction, $h(\tau)$ are
obtained as a function of time using the four scenarios mentioned above. 

  For $R_{\rm QGP}$ and $R_{\rm hadron}$, we use the parameterized forms
given in Ref.~\cite{THOMA}. The QGP rate corresponds to 
the photon production rate from an equilibrated 2 flavour
QGP, calculated in perturbative thermal QCD.
  The contribution of prompt photons, produced in the initial 
scattering has been obtained by the PYTHIA
calculations of Ref.~\cite{GALLMEISTER} and are parameterized as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{promp}
E \frac{dN}{d^3 p} = \exp(a + bP_T + cP_T^2 + dP_T^3), \,\, {\rm with} \nonumber\\
  a=-5.9883,\,\, b=2.0934,\,\, c=-1.6015,\,\, d=0.1432.
\end{eqnarray}


   Figure~2 demonstrates how the thermal photon contributions due to 
different evolutions compare with SPS data (filled circles). The prompt 
photons (thick solid line) have been added in all calculations.
 The idealized Maxwell construction corresponds to the short dashed line.
The full nucleation and supercooling (scenario 2) corresponds to 
the middle dashed line which shows more photons in the low 
$P_T$ region. This is due to the fact that the system has spent more
time in region with temperature lower than $T_C$. 
  The scenario (3) (long dashed line) looks the most improbable at SPS 
energies. The analysis of CERES dilepton data shows signatures of 
in-medium effects and mass shifts of $\rho$ and $\phi$ mesons~\cite{RAPP} 
supporting above conclusion. 
 Scenario (1), (2) and (4) give equally good description of the photon
spectrum at SPS. 

  In conclusions, we have presented the results of investigations on 
different scenarios of a first order phase transition and analyzed
SPS photon spectrum. The Supercooling which is an essential 
feature of first order phase transition has been included in the work.
We find that the effect of supercooling is to marginally increase the 
photons in the low $P_T$ region. From the space time integrated 
photon yield at SPS it is not possible to clearly delineate the effect 
of supercooling. A sudden hadronization scenario is also ruled 
out at SPS.
